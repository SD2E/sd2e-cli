* You are a member of a [TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu) project with an active allocation to use [TACC systems](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/hpc), that is, either:
  * You have your own TACC project allocation (e.g. through [XSEDE](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations-overview)) _or_
  * You are developing a public CyVerse application and thus have access to the iPlant-Collabs project allocation (to request access to this allocation, join the [Agave Platform on Slack](https://slackin.agaveapi.co) and message John Fonner)

* You can successully login to TACC's [Stampede](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede) and/or [Lonestar5](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/lonestar5) HPC systems
